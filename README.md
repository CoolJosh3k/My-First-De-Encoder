# My-First-De-Encoder
Learning C++, this is my very first program.
It is a naive, run-length encoder and decoder.

This is intented as a showcase, and possibly as a learning resource for others.

Note that the code is written in this odd way, as it was to encourage my own learning. These is no goal to have it easy to read, performant or elegant.

This finished project does not contain full support for the other modes.
